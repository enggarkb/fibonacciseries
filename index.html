  <h1> What is Fibonacci sequence/series?</h1>
  <pre >
          In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fâ‚™, form a sequence,
          the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
          The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial
          terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2.
